# Arturs Mekss Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal. It will prompt you before it does anything destructive. Check out the [Rakefile](https://github.com/AMekss/dotfiles/blob/master/Rakefile) to see exactly what it does.

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/AMekss/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
rake install
```

After installing, open a new terminal window to see the effects.
